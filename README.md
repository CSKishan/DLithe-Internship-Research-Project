# Movie Recommendation System

### Description
Movie recommendation system has become popular over the last decade with the rise of streaming platforms. People who don't go to theatres but rather switch on to Netflix or Amazon Prime for their weekend dose of entertainment rely heavily on this system. Each person has his or her own tastes in movies. Their favourite actors, favourite actresses, preferred genres, specific languages and many more influence the movies that they will see. One of the more important criteria to pick movies to watch is that of rating. Movies are rated by critics and viewers based on their technicality, the story, the production etc. These ratings, more often than not, do justice to the movie and is reviewed by a large number of the public. Hence, it is reasonable to pick movies with higher rating to watch, as you are guaranteed a good story and direction in the process. The following system is built with the help of ratings given to movies by the viewers.
